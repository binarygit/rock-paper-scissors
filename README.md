Just going to code in Js rn, the HTML and CSS part will come later

things to do: 

1. Make function 'computerPlay' which randomly returns rock, paper or scissors.
2. Write func(playerSelection, computerSelection) that plays a round of the game
and then returns a string which delares the winner & loser. 
3. Write a func called game which plays 5 round of game and which keeps score and
reports result at the end. 
4. Use prompt to get input from the user. 

pseudocode: 

make a func that getsinput from user and passes it into another function
that turns the input into lowecase letters
create an array containing rock, paper, scissors
use math.random to select one of the three and return it
In func(P.S, C.S) input getfunc and select function 
in select func create logic for win and lose
logic:
use a switch statement, where the human's input is taken into account and based
on that results are drawn. Eg: if human selects rock, enter switch 1, case 1, 
if comp is rock then log draw. and so on. 
Create two var with name scoreTrackuser and comp in game() 
Create a loop that runs select() 5 times
Write a if statement into the loop which 
if the str.index finds user then user++, if not then comp++
Write if statement out of the loop, in which the one with higher no. wins.
