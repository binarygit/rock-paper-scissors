Made the intro animation. It took me this whole day, about 6 hours of work. It has come off nicely. 
However, I've yet to figure out how to use Timeset() properly and that is messing things up for me. 
Hopefully I'll be done by tomorrow and can show to my friends.

Well, this is the "first complete draft". Took me a lot of time to get to here. Feels like a month, but it seems it's just been 4 days. 
I'm happy with what I have, although I think it's a bit rougher on some edges, but overall I feel good about it.
